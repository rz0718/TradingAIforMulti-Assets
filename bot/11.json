I must never risk more than 1-2% of total capital per trade. My account has $10,000 available cash, so 1-2% is $100 to $200 per trade risk.\n\nI need to provide a trading decision for each ticker: ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. The signal can be "hold", "entry", or "close". Since I have no open positions (margin allocated is 0, unrealized PnL is 0), I can only "entry" or "hold" (which means no action).\n\nFor each ticker, I must analyze the market snapshot and decide if there\'s a high-probability setup.\n\nLet\'s look at each ticker:\n\n- **ETH**: Price: 3998.940, EMA20: 4000.457 (slightly above), MACD: -2.904 (negative but improving), RSI(7): 49.442 (neutral). Intraday prices are mixed, RSI oscillating. No clear trend or signal. Funding rate is slightly negative, open interest stable. Not a strong setup.\n\n- **SOL**: Price: 194.220, EMA20: 194.264 (almost equal), MACD: -0.097 (negative but small), RSI(7): 49.673 (neutral). Similar to ETH, no clear direction. Funding rate negative, open interest stable. Not compelling.\n\n- **XRP**: Price: 2.647, EMA20: 2.640 (slightly above), MACD: 0.006 (positive but small), RSI(7): 61.338 (approaching overbought). Intraday shows a slight uptrend, RSI is high. Funding rate positive. Might be a bullish sign, but RSI is high, could be due for a pullback. Not sure.\n\n- **BTC**: Price: 113019.990, EMA20: 112982.160 (slightly above), MACD: -41.034 (negative but improving), RSI(7): 59.279 (neutral to slightly bullish). Intraday mixed, RSI improving. Funding rate positive. BTC is often a leader, but not a clear entry point here.\n\n- **DOGE**: Price: 0.193, EMA20: 0.193 (equal), MACD: -0.000 (neutral), RSI(7): 54.492 (neutral). Very stable, no movement. Not a good opportunity.\n\n- **BNB**: Price: 1113.110, EMA20: 1114.966 (slightly below), MACD: -0.009 (negative), RSI(7): 33.004 (oversold). RSI is low, might be a buying opportunity, but MACD negative, and price is below EMA20. Funding rate negative. Could be a contrarian play, but need to be careful.\n\nOverall, no ticker shows a very strong signal. The market seems range-bound or consolidating. As per my rules, I should stay inactive most of the time and only trade when high-probability setups emerge. None of these look like high-probability.\n\nFor each ticker, I should output "hold" since there\'s no position to close or strong reason to enter.\n\nThe JSON structure must include all keys, with empty strings for side and justification for hold signals.\n\nLeverage, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss should be set to something, but for hold, since no position, I need to set them appropriately. Looking at the examples:\n\n- For hold, in EXAMPLE 2, they have leverage, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss filled, but they are maintaining a position. Since I have no positions, I should set those to 0 or empty, but the field definitions say for hold, side and justification are empty, but leverage, quantity, etc., might need to be set based on if there was a position.\n\nIn the instructions: "If signal is "hold": side, justification MUST be empty strings "" " – it doesn\'t specify about leverage, quantity, etc. But in EXAMPLE 2, they have values for leverage, quantity, etc., because they have an open position.\n\nSince I have no open positions, for hold signals, I should set leverage, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss to 0 or something, but the example doesn\'t show for no position.\n\nRe-reading: "Open positions and performance details:" – it says margin allocated is 0, so no positions.\n\nIn the JSON, for each ticker, if I say "hold", and there\'s no position, perhaps I should set leverage to 0, quantity to 0, etc., but the example has values.\n\nThe instruction says: "Always include all keys, but set irrelevant ones to empty string """ – but for numeric fields, it might be 0.0.\n\nIn EXAMPLE 2, it\'s for maintaining a position, so they have values.\n\nFor no position, I think I should set numeric fields to 0.0 where appropriate.\n\nBut to be consistent, I\'ll set for hold signals: signal: "hold", side: "", leverage: 0, quantity: 0.0, profit_target: 0.0, stop_loss: 0.0, confidence: 0.0 or something, but confidence might be for the decision.\n\nLooking at EXAMPLE 2, confidence is 0.75, so I need to provide a confidence level even for hold.\n\nInvalidation_condition might be empty.\n\nFor hold with no position, perhaps confidence should be low, and set numeric fields to 0.\n\nBut the system might expect values. To be safe, I\'ll follow the structure.\n\nSince I\'m not entering any trades, for all tickers, signal: "hold", side: "", leverage: 0 (or perhaps 1, but better 0), quantity: 0.0, profit_target: 0.0, stop_loss: 0.0, confidence: some low number, invalidation_condition: "", justification: "".\n\nConfidence for hold could be based on how uncertain I am.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, since no setups, confidence 0.0.\n\nNow, for the JSON, I need to output for each ticker.\n\nThe tickers are ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB.\n\nI\'ll do hold for all.\n\nConfidence: since no clear signal, I\'ll set confidence to 0.5 or something neutral.\n\nIn EXAMPLE 2, confidence is 0.75 for hold, so it\'s the confidence in the current position, but I have none, so perhaps 0.0.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I\'ll set confidence to 0.0 for hold when no position.\n\nInvalidation_condition empty.\n\nJustification empty.\n\nNow, for the JSON structure, it must be a valid JSON object with keys for each ticker.\n\nSo, something like:\n\n{\n  "ETH": {\n    "signal": "hold",\n    "side": "",\n    "leverage": 0,\n    "quantity": 0.0,\n    "profit_target": 0.0,\n    "stop_loss": 0.0,\n    "confidence": 0.0,\n    "invalidation_condition": "",\n    "justification": ""\n  },\n  "SOL": { ... same ... },\n  ...\n}\n\nBut leverage is an integer in examples, like 10, so I should use integer 0.\n\nQuantity is float, so 0.0.\n\nProfit_target and stop_loss float 0.0.\n\nConfidence is float between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, is there any ticker that might have a slight edge?\n\nLooking at BNB, RSI is oversold at 33.004, price below EMA20, but MACD negative. Might be a potential long, but not strong enough. Funding rate negative, which could indicate bearish sentiment, but RSI oversold might suggest bounce.\n\nHowever, as per rules, only trade high-probability setups, and this isn\'t clear.
